          <h3 class="major">Q: If I decide to list my home charger on EVE,
            how do I make money? </h3>
          <p>A: You decide how much you want to charge for
            the use of your charger. EVE will inform you of the
            average price charged by other home charger owners
            in your area, and you will receive periodical
            notifications about any changes in the average
            price in your area. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h3 class="major">Q: How do I know that I can trust the person who
            is coming to my driveway/garage?</h3>
          <p>A: We’ve designed a set of functionalities to
            ensure trust between the different users of the app.
            Your address will not be displayed unless someone
            books your charger. Once you receive a booking, you
            will also get info about the driver (name, the type
            of car they drive, the rating they received from other
            home charger owners). Should you wish to cancel the
            booking based on this information, you will be free
            to do so. At the end of the session, you will be
            asked to rate the user and provide feedback on your
            session. Users who reach an average rating of less
            than 4,6 out 5 will not be able to use the app anymore. </p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="major">Q: Who is liable if any damages are
            done to my property? </h3>
          <p>A: It is the driver’s responsibility to leave your
            property in the same condition in which he
            or she has found it.

            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 class="major">Q: How can I make sure that my
              charger will still be available to me when I need it?</h3>
            <p>A: You can specify the days of the week and the time
              of day when you would like your charger to be
              made available. At the same time, once someone
              books your charger, it will not be displayed on
              the map until it becomes available again. In the
              unlikely situation that a driver leaves their car
              in your driveway, you should reach our customer
              service department so we can contact the driver
              or escalate the situation with authorities.
            </p>
